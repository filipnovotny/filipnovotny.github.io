              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>
              I lead the Machine Learning team currently working on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uwbdzQxhGE" target="_blank">first autonomous underwater drone</a>.
              It is a team made of talented individuals hired through a selective process who are adressing some of the toughest engineering challenges in the field of underwater drones.
              Sure that sentence sounds a bit boastful, it's my way of saying I really like my team :).
              </p>
              <p>
              I work on projects involving <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> for classification and detection of underwater objects.
              My interests also involve <strong>time series prediction</strong> and data analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
              I enjoy speaking and conferences, my last presentation was titled: <em>Hate is a time series</em> and demonstrates how to use time series databases together with tensorflow to estimate cultural sentiment in Kyrgyzstan.
              </p>
              <p>
              Last but not least, love travelling by hitchhiking, I've crossed all eurasia like that and
              <a href="http://takemeeast.blogspot.com">you can read about it</a>. My lovely wife comes from far away herself and we've shared many stories together which inspire me during my teamwork and my presentations.</p>

              <h2>Underwater drones</h2>
              <p>
              My deep learning experiences have to do mostly with underwater detection. Basically, we build and program an underwater drone to remotely
              navigate around a boat, object or building and detect regions of interest using convolutional neural networks.</p>
              <p>
                For those who find the concept weird, an underwater drone is like a flying drone except more annoying to build because you don't have any GPS localisation, no wifi, bluetooth or usual data-carying waves whatsoever. Light is diffused, vision is often restricted to a few meters at best.
                As for mechanical problems, we are subject to pressure and currents.
              </p>
              <p>
                For all those reasons, software engineering underwater brings its unique sets of challenges.
              </p>
              <p>I use transfer learning and data augmentation to train on reduced datasets and underwater conditions.</p>
              <p>Problems I have worked on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classification of fish</li>
                    <li>Classification of types of drone trajectories</li>
                    <li>Classification of rigid or deformable surfaces (boat hulls)</li>
                    <li>Diver detection accross a variety of poses</li>
                    <li>Detection of boat parts (hull parts, biofouling...)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below are some detection achieved using my ML-based algorithms:</p>

            When we were programming the drone for leisure purposes, my goal is to detect and follow the diver. The diver carries a small device emitting ultrasound waves which are received and analyzed by the drone onboard computer. We first perform a coarse acoustic localisation of the diver before locking on target with computer vision. The work started on a first large prototype and was then refined incrementally through two series of prototypes.

              <p>
              I've done a bit more work in another reseach lab at the French research center for Nuclear Energy (CEA) on human pose estimation. The goal of that project was to detect different body parts of a human subject transformed into a 3D pointcloud using a ToF camera and estimate his/her pose using that data. No markers were used.
              </p>
              <p>
                The detection is done using boosted Haar Classifiers and graph traversal. This was before the widespread use of neural nets and could run at a few frames per second.

            The Raspberry Pi is a cheap and reasonably robust and able solution to serve as a central embedded computer
            for drones. Some companies are pushing its limits to incorporate image
            processing algorithms and even, more recently, simplified and somewhat optimised machine learning abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bulk of complexity in the above mentioned algorithms is in the Optic Flow for the majority of
            tracking algorithms and Forward Propagation for a lot of Machine learning applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            These algorithms are well-known and parallelize very efficiently; they are therefore often ported on GPUs,
            especially NVIDIA’s CUDA cores which spectacular performance increase. However, there is no reliable
            implementation on embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi 3 leaving those platforms not only less
            powerful but also underused compared to their expensive CUDA-enabled counterparts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
            The intern’s task will be to study and understand the above mentioned algorithms and parallelize them on
            the Raspberry Pi 3’s QPUs in order to harness enough of the embedded device’s power to achieve a real
            time performance.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I had two interns, one specialized in Computer Vision and the second one in low-level programming.
            The idea was to program the Optic Flow and ANN inference from scratch and then directly use GPU assembly on the Raspberry Pi GPU to program the underlaying low-level mathematical operations (convolutions, gradient descent) in order to achieve optimal performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two interns worked together work is structured as follows.

          <p>
            Some optimisations were done using the fact that optical flow is computed in an underwater environement which leads to certains assumptions on pyramid level and convergence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of the internship focused on automatic diver recognition in real time on the Raspberry pi. This was done using mobile machine learning techniques.

              This talk is an analysis of time series obtained by creating a data analytics pipeline using the google machine learning API. An outile of this talk can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OHRVr-T8hxKlW5-VrjhmWfwtR1iyy0r5CDA-RB8GMwo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

              I demonstrate how to combine InfluxDB with Tensorflow and do some non-trivial predictions. The talk is structured around the sociatal problem of mixed couples in the Kyrgyz society. It uses the google Natural Language API to analyze sentiment from various messages in order to generate trainable data.
          </p>
          <p>
              The presentation starts with a live demonstration of the google machine learning cloud API. A (fairly negative) message is read through a microphone and speech recognition transcribes it in russian. The machine learning translation API makes a translation in english and at the same time the natural language API infers a sentiment.
          </p>

              Following that example, the presentation proceeds to explain that we can use the same process to model "hate" this way (hence the title hate is a time series) and goes on to use other machine learning tools to predict time series.

              The time series we examine is the hate recieved by my wife (a Kyrgyz national) and myself (French) as we were trying to live together and marry. The following curve shows an interval taken from such a time series:

            Engineering is not merely a thing that you practice in an office, it can be very useful in survival situations as well. This is especially true for computer engineering. This talk is basically a walkthrough through my year-long hitchhiking trip and how it relates to teamwork in a software company.
              </p>
              <p>
            I gave this talk on the Grenoble INP campus in front of more than 200 people. It had been my first experience in front of such a "large" audience and it was a fun one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately there were a few issues while filming the talk and I could only recover excerpts:

              There is a fear of the unknown for many companies towards the use of modern technologies such as C++ 17, docker, cmake...
              This fear exists in the AI wolrd as well with many companies still rely techniques such as Viola-Jones for classification "because it works", even after the immense breakthrough from Neural Networks.
          </p><p>
              In a number of ways, we are being traditional, dogmatic, wanting to keep our old way of developement even with the emergence of new tools that have proved helpful to others. As a result of them companies keep reinventing... and in the worst case scenario... they don't even consider the wheel as being a useful thing.
            </p><p>
              There is a similar thing happening with growing nationalism in developping countries such as Kyrgyzstan, the birthplace of my wife. A tradition, or tool, commonly used for marriage there is bride kidnapping. While it is a method which is considered to "have always worked", there are many better alternatives in our modern society but too few take them.
            </p><p>
              Of course such a violent analogy is meant as a provocation but I feel it stresses the importance of new tools (C++17 and cmake specifically in that talk) in an efficient team and the idea of efficiency connected with the right tools. There is also a part commenting the transition towards those tools.
            </p><p>
              The presentation is structured around two testimonies:
            </p><p>
              one from a Kyrgyz girl who got kidnapped and forcefully maried off
              one from an intern discovering a first professional experience in a company
              I had, of course, the permission to use those testimonies. The talk is in French (sorry, no subtitles) and was given at the "Agile Lyon" conference in Lyon in 2017.
